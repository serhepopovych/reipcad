Create files with name "${iface}.conf" here with
following contents:

    iface=eth0
    peer_name='ISP name'
    my_asn=64496
    their_asn=64511

    cat >"${iface}.conf" <<EOF

    # ${peer_name} (${my_asn} <-> ${their_asn})
    interface ${iface} promisc;
    EOF

You can also use add_iface.sh to ease addition
and then possibly edit generated by it ${iface}.conf
file to meet needs. Thus

    add_iface.sh <iface> <peer_name> <my_asn> <their_asn>

would create <iface>.conf file in current directory
with contents like

    # <peer_name> (<my_asn> <-> <their_asn>)
    interface <iface> promisc;

Following example

   add_port.sh eth0 'ISP name' 64496 64511

will add following record to the <iface>.conf file:

   # ISP name (64496 <-> 64511)
   interface eth0 promisc;
