Create files with name "as${asn}.conf" here with
following contents:

    asn=64496

    prefix1=192.0.2.0/24
    strip1=24

    prefix2=198.51.100.0/24
    strip2=28

    prefix3=203.0.113.0/24
    strip3=25

    cat >"as${asn}.conf" <<EOF

    # AS${asn}
    aggregate ${prefix1} strip ${strip1};
    aggregate ${prefix2} strip ${strip2};
    aggregate ${prefix3} strip ${strip3};
    EOF

Data for statistics aggregation could be feed from
RSes /netctl/etc/*/xml/customers.xml
<net>prefix</net> tags for given autonomous system.

You can also use add_net.sh to automatically
fetch network prefixes from whois "route" object
for given origin ASN and possibly edit generated
by it as${asn}.conf file to meet needs. Thus

    add_net.sh <asn>

would create as<asn>.conf file in current directory
with contents like

    # AS<asn>
    aggregate <net>/<plen> strip <plen>;
    aggregate <net>/<plen> strip <plen>;
    ...

where <net>/<plen> data is taken from whois database,
aggregated by aggregate(1) and sorted by sort(1).
