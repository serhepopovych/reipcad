Create files with name "${into}.conf" here with
following contents:

    port=1024-65535
    into=65535

    cat >"${into}.conf" <<EOF

    # ${into}
    aggregate ${port} into ${into};
    EOF

You can also use add_port.sh to ease addition
and then possibly edit generated by it ${into}.conf
file to meet needs. Thus

    add_port.sh <into> <port_from> [<port_to>]

would create <into>.conf file in current directory
with contents like

    # <into>
    aggregate <port_from>[-<port_to>] into <into>;
    ...

Following example

   add_port.sh 65535 1024 65535

will add following record to the 65535.conf file:

   # 65535
   aggregate 1024-65535 into 65535;
